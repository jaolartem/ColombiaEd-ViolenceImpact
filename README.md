# Data Science Project: Understanding the Relationship between Violence and Colombian Saber Test Outcomes

This repository houses an in-depth analysis aiming to decipher the intricate relationship between various forms of violence and the outcomes of the Saber Tests in Colombia. By leveraging quantitative approaches and state-of-the-art data analysis tools, the goal is to derive actionable insights that could be pivotal for public policy and educational program formulations.

## :construction: Project Status: Under Construction

The project is currently in the initial stages of the ETL process. Although substantial progress has been made, there's still an exciting journey ahead.

### :heavy_check_mark: Achievements So Far:
- **Modular Design**: Implementation of a well-structured and modular ETL process.
- **Data Extraction**: Successful extraction of data from CSV formats, with plans to incorporate *.txt files.
- **Database Schematics**: Preliminary design of table structures and schemas for database integration.

### :soon: Upcoming Milestones:
1. Complete data extraction for remaining formats, especially *.txt.
2. Dive deep into the transformation phase, ensuring data integrity and relevance.
3. Seamlessly integrate the transformed data into the designed database structures.
4. Embark on a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) journey.
5. Harness the power of machine learning algorithms to unearth hidden patterns and correlations.
6. Craft compelling visual stories using tools like Tableau and PowerBI.
7. Translate findings into geospatial representations for a more intuitive understanding.

# Data Science Project: Exploring the Relationship between Violence and Colombian Saber Test Results

In this repository, we delve into the intricate world of violence and its potential impact on educational outcomes, as represented by the Saber tests in Colombia. Employing rigorous data analysis methodologies and a systematic approach, this project seeks to shed light on patterns and correlations that might be instrumental for decision-makers in the educational and public policy sectors.

## :construction: Project Status: In Progress

The project has made significant strides in understanding, processing, and preparing the data for detailed analysis. While the extraction phase has been largely completed, the transformation phase is currently underway. The next steps will involve a thorough data analysis, visualization, and modeling to decipher the intricate relationship between violence and educational outcomes.

### :heavy_check_mark: Achievements So Far:

- **Modular Design**: Developed a modular and systematic approach to the ETL process, with separate modules for different file formats.
- **Data Extraction**: Successfully extracted data from multiple file formats, including CSV and TXT.
- **Database Schemas**: Designed a robust database structure with multiple schemas to represent different facets of violence.
- **File Processing**: Implemented functionalities to detect and process various file formats and backup for traceability.

### :soon: Upcoming Milestones:

1. Complete the data transformation phase, ensuring data integrity, relevance, and alignment with the database structure.
2. Load the transformed data into the designed database tables.
3. Embark on a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations.
4. Apply machine learning techniques to predict or classify based on the data.
5. Visualize findings using tools like Tableau and PowerBI to provide clear and actionable insights.
6. Translate findings into geospatial representations for a holistic understanding of the data.
7. Document the complete project, including methodologies, decisions, results, and insights.
