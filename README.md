# Data Science Project: Exploring the Relationship between Violence and Colombian Saber Test Results

In this repository, we delve into the intricate world of violence and its potential impact on educational outcomes, as represented by the Saber tests in Colombia. Employing rigorous data analysis methodologies and a systematic approach, this project seeks to shed light on patterns and correlations that might be instrumental for decision-makers in the educational and public policy sectors.

## :construction: Project Status: In Progress

The project has made significant strides in understanding, processing, and preparing the data for detailed analysis. While the extraction phase has been largely completed, the transformation phase is currently underway. The next steps will involve a thorough data analysis, visualization, and modeling to decipher the intricate relationship between violence and educational outcomes.

### :heavy_check_mark: Achievements So Far:

- **Modular Design**: Developed a modular and systematic approach to the ETL process, with separate modules for different file formats.
- **Data Extraction**: Successfully extracted data from multiple file formats, including CSV and TXT.
- **Database Schemas**: Designed a robust database structure with multiple schemas to represent different facets of violence.
- **File Processing**: Implemented functionalities to detect and process various file formats and backup for traceability.

### :soon: Upcoming Milestones:

1. Complete the data transformation phase, ensuring data integrity, relevance, and alignment with the database structure.
2. Load the transformed data into the designed database tables.
3. Embark on a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations.
4. Apply machine learning techniques to predict or classify based on the data.
5. Visualize findings using tools like Tableau and PowerBI to provide clear and actionable insights.
6. Translate findings into geospatial representations for a holistic understanding of the data.
7. Document the complete project, including methodologies, decisions, results, and insights.

## :wrench: Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: The backbone of the project, instrumental in data processing and analysis.
- **SQL**: For structured data storage and complex query operations.
- **Excel**: Initial data understanding and minor transformations.
- **PowerBI** (Planned): For crafting informative and interactive dashboards.
- **Tableau** (Planned): Another visualization tool to diversify representation.
