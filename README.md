# Data Science Project: Understanding the Relationship between Violence and Colombian Saber Test Outcomes

This repository houses an in-depth analysis aiming to decipher the intricate relationship between various forms of violence and the outcomes of the Saber Tests in Colombia. By leveraging quantitative approaches and state-of-the-art data analysis tools, the goal is to derive actionable insights that could be pivotal for public policy and educational program formulations.

## :construction: Project Status: Under Construction

The project is currently in the initial stages of the ETL process. Although substantial progress has been made, there's still an exciting journey ahead.

### :heavy_check_mark: Achievements So Far:
- **Modular Design**: Implementation of a well-structured and modular ETL process.
- **Data Extraction**: Successful extraction of data from CSV formats, with plans to incorporate *.txt files.
- **Database Schematics**: Preliminary design of table structures and schemas for database integration.

### :soon: Upcoming Milestones:
1. Complete data extraction for remaining formats, especially *.txt.
2. Dive deep into the transformation phase, ensuring data integrity and relevance.
3. Seamlessly integrate the transformed data into the designed database structures.
4. Embark on a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) journey.
5. Harness the power of machine learning algorithms to unearth hidden patterns and correlations.
6. Craft compelling visual stories using tools like Tableau and PowerBI.
7. Translate findings into geospatial representations for a more intuitive understanding.

## :wrench: Tools & Technologies Employed

- **Python**: The backbone of the project, instrumental in data processing and analysis.
- **SQL**: For structured data storage and complex query operations.
- **Excel**: Initial data understanding and minor transformations.
- **PowerBI** (Planned): For crafting interactive and insightful dashboards.
- **Tableau** (Planned): Another visualization tool to diversify representation.
